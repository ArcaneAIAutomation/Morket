# Morket

A modern GTM (Go-To-Market) data engine — think Clay.com, built from scratch. Morket provides data enrichment orchestration, multi-tenant workspace management, and a consumption-based credit system, all backed by a robust TypeScript/Express API.

## What is Morket?

Morket helps sales and marketing teams enrich their prospect data by orchestrating calls to multiple data providers (Apollo, Clearbit, LinkedIn, etc.) through a unified platform. Teams get:

- **Multi-tenant workspaces** to organize enrichment activities
- **Encrypted credential storage** for third-party API keys
- **Consumption-based billing** with credit tracking
- **Role-based access control** across workspace members
- **A spreadsheet-like UI** for managing and enriching data (coming soon)

The backend follows a layered architecture: **Routes → Controllers → Services → Repositories**, with each domain (auth, workspace, credential, credit, enrichment) as a self-contained module.

## Current Status: Module 3 — Scraping Microservices 🔄

Modules 1 and 2 are fully implemented with 400 tests passing across 43 test files. Module 3 (Scraping Microservices) is in the requirements phase.

### What's built

#### Module 1: Core Backend Foundation
- **JWT Authentication** — Register, login, refresh token rotation, logout. Bcrypt (12 rounds), rate-limited auth endpoints (5/min per IP).
- **RBAC Middleware** — Role hierarchy (owner > admin > member > viewer), workspace-scoped permissions enforced at the middleware level.
- **Workspace Management** — CRUD with slug generation, member management (add/remove/update role), last-owner protection.
- **Encrypted Credential Storage** — AES-256-GCM with HKDF per-workspace key derivation. API responses only expose masked keys (last 4 chars).
- **Credit/Billing System** — Consumption-based credits with `SELECT FOR UPDATE` concurrency control, auto-recharge, immutable transaction ledger, paginated history.
- **API Infrastructure** — Consistent JSON envelope responses, X-Request-Id tracing, structured JSON logging, Helmet security headers, CORS, sliding-window rate limiting.

#### Module 2: Enrichment Orchestration
- **Provider Registry** — In-memory registry with Apollo, Clearbit, and Hunter providers. Each provider has Zod input/output schemas, credit costs, and supported fields.
- **Provider Adapters** — Pluggable adapter interface (`ProviderAdapter`) with HTTP calls, 30s timeouts, and error mapping.
- **Circuit Breaker** — Sliding window (10 calls, 5 failure threshold, 60s cooldown) per provider to protect against cascading failures.
- **Enrichment Jobs** — Create, list, get, and cancel enrichment jobs. Input validation, credit estimation, balance checking, and batch splitting (1000 records max).
- **Temporal.io Workflows** — Durable enrichment workflows with waterfall provider logic, idempotency keys, cancellation signals, and automatic status tracking.
- **Webhook Delivery** — HMAC-SHA256 signed webhooks with 10s timeout and 3 retries with exponential backoff (5s, 10s, 20s).
- **Database Migrations** — 11 sequential migration files covering all tables and indexes.
- **33 Correctness Properties** — Property-based tests using fast-check validating circuit breaker, waterfall, idempotency, and credit invariants.

## Testing

```bash
npm test              # Run all 400 tests
npm run test:watch    # Watch mode
npm run test:coverage # With coverage report
```

The test suite includes:
- **Unit tests** — Schema validation, error classes, middleware behavior, service logic, adapter behavior
- **Property-based tests** — 33 correctness properties with 100+ iterations each (fast-check) covering auth, RBAC, workspace, credential, credit, circuit breaker, waterfall enrichment, and idempotency
- **Integration tests** — Full HTTP flows: register → login → workspace → credentials → billing → enrichment jobs → webhooks → providers

## Roadmap

### ✅ Module 1: Core Backend Foundation
> *Status: Complete*

Express.js API gateway, PostgreSQL schema, JWT auth with refresh rotation, RBAC, workspace management, AES-256-GCM credential encryption, credit/billing system, 27 property-based correctness tests.

---

### ✅ Module 2: Enrichment Orchestration
> *Status: Complete*

Temporal.io workflow engine for orchestrating multi-step data enrichment pipelines. Each enrichment action consumes credits and calls external data providers using stored credentials.

- Temporal.io worker and workflow definitions
- Provider adapter registry (Apollo, Clearbit, Hunter) with pluggable interface
- Waterfall enrichment (try provider A, fall back to B) with idempotency keys
- Credit consumption per action with rollback on failure
- Circuit breaker (sliding window, 5 failure threshold, 60s cooldown)
- Webhook callbacks with HMAC-SHA256 signatures and retry logic
- Job status tracking, batch splitting (1000 records max), and cancellation
- 6 property-based correctness tests for waterfall, idempotency, circuit breaker, and credits

---

### 🔄 Module 3: Scraping Microservices
> *Status: In Progress (Requirements Phase)*

Python/FastAPI/Playwright scraping service for data sources without APIs. Runs as a standalone microservice communicating with the backend via REST API. Acts as an enrichment provider callable by Temporal.io workflows.

- FastAPI service with Pydantic validation and OpenAPI docs
- Playwright headless Chromium browser pool (5–20 instances, auto-recycling)
- Pluggable page extractors: LinkedIn profiles, company websites, job postings
- Anti-detection: fingerprint randomization, webdriver masking, human-like delays
- Proxy rotation with health monitoring and per-domain cooldowns
- Per-domain rate limiting (token bucket) with YAML policy overrides and robots.txt compliance
- Circuit breaker per target domain (sliding window, 120s cooldown)
- Credential retrieval from backend with in-memory caching (5min TTL)
- Result normalization into Pydantic models matching enrichment pipeline schemas
- Async task queue with priority scheduling and concurrency control
- Batch processing (max 100 targets) with job lifecycle management
- HMAC-SHA256 signed webhook callbacks with retry logic
- Docker multi-stage build with resource limits (2 CPU, 4GB RAM)
- Structured JSON logging, /metrics and /health endpoints
- 15 requirements with 97 acceptance criteria

---

### 🔲 Module 4: Spreadsheet UI
> *Status: Planned*

React-based spreadsheet interface using AG Grid for high-performance data manipulation. The primary user interface for viewing, editing, and enriching prospect data.

- React 18+ with TypeScript and Zustand state management
- AG Grid with DOM virtualization for 100k+ row datasets
- Column-level enrichment triggers (right-click → enrich)
- Real-time updates via WebSocket/SSE
- CSV/Excel import and export
- Tailwind CSS styling with responsive layout
- Keyboard shortcuts and bulk operations

---

### 🔲 Module 5: OLAP Analytics Layer
> *Status: Planned*

ClickHouse integration for analytical queries across enrichment data. Separates read-heavy analytics from the OLTP PostgreSQL database.

- ClickHouse schema with ReplacingMergeTree for deduplication
- CDC pipeline from PostgreSQL → ClickHouse
- Pre-aggregated materialized views for dashboards
- Enrichment success rate analytics
- Credit usage analytics and forecasting
- API endpoints for dashboard data

---

### 🔲 Module 6: Search
> *Status: Planned*

OpenSearch/ElasticSearch integration for full-text search across enriched prospect data.

- OpenSearch index management and mapping
- Real-time indexing pipeline from PostgreSQL
- Full-text search with fuzzy matching and filters
- Faceted search (by company, title, location, etc.)
- Search result ranking and relevance tuning
- Typeahead/autocomplete API

---

### 🔲 Module 7: Infrastructure & DevOps
> *Status: Planned*

Production-grade infrastructure on AWS with CI/CD automation.

- Docker multi-stage builds for all services
- Terraform IaC for AWS (ECS Fargate, Aurora, S3, ElastiCache)
- GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline (lint → test → build → deploy)
- Redis caching layer for workspace configs and session data
- CloudWatch logging and alerting
- Blue/green deployment strategy
